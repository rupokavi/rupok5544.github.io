#### Research Mentor
In addition to conducting individual research, I mentor enthusiastic students from three top Bangladeshi universities: KUET, AIUB, and SUST. Most of these students are in their 3rd and 4th years of study. My role involves teaching them scientific research methodology, article writing, research ethics, and journal formatting. I also help them acquire funding to support their research endeavors. I am proud to have mentored two talented undergraduate admission aspirants in the USA, one of whom has already been admitted with a fully-funded scholarship.

_Current Students_:
* Saleh Akram Naife (KUET)
* Adiba Abid (KUET)
* Raihan Rafi Prottoy (KUET)
* Sadman Mohammad Nasif (KUET)
* MD Zaid Hossain (KUET)
* Ashraf Raiyan (KUET)
* Fatema Tuj Johora Lima (SUST)
* Md Wahiduzzaman Suva (AIUB)
* Shahriar Soudeep (AIUB)
* Md. Ariful Islam (AIUB)
* 2 groups of students (quantum machine learning and graph learning research), each consisting of 4 members from AIUB
    - Khalid Bin Mahamud Bhuiya
    - Md. Ashfaq Bin Hoque
    - Md. Mostakim Ali
    - Md. Sakib Sarwar
