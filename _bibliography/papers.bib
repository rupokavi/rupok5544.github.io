	abstract = {Soybean leaf disease detection is critical for agricultural productivity but faces challenges due to visually similar symptoms and limited interpretability in conventional methods. While Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) excel in spatial feature extraction, they often neglect inter-image relational dependencies, leading to misclassifications. This paper proposes an interpretable hybrid Sequential CNN-Graph Neural Network (GNN) framework that synergizes MobileNetV2 for localized feature extraction and GraphSAGE for relational modeling. The framework constructs a graph where nodes represent leaf images, with edges defined by cosine similarity-based adjacency matrices and adaptive neighborhood sampling. This design captures fine-grained lesion features and global symptom patterns, addressing inter-class similarity challenges. Cross-modal interpretability is achieved via Grad-CAM and Eigen-CAM visualizations, generating heatmaps to highlight disease-influential regions. Evaluated on a dataset of ten soybean leaf diseases, the model achieves 97.16% accuracy, surpassing standalone CNNs (≤95.04%) and traditional machine learning models (≤77.05%). Ablation studies validate the sequential architecture's superiority over parallel or single-model configurations. With only 2.3 million parameters, the lightweight MobileNetV2-GraphSAGE combination ensures computational efficiency, enabling real-time deployment in resource-constrained environments. The proposed approach bridges the gap between accurate classification and practical applicability, offering a robust, interpretable tool for agricultural diagnostics while advancing CNN-GNN integration in plant pathology research.},

	abstract = {Cybersecurity threats are growing, making network intrusion detection essential. Traditional machine learning models remain effective in resource-limited environments due to their efficiency, requiring fewer parameters and less computational time. However, handling short and highly imbalanced datasets remains challenging. In this study, we propose the fusion of a Contrastive Attentive Graph Network and Graph Attention Network (CAGN-GAT Fusion) and benchmark it against 15 other models, including both Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and traditional ML models. Our evaluation is conducted on four benchmark datasets (KDD-CUP-1999, NSL-KDD, UNSW-NB15, and CICIDS2017) using a short and proportionally imbalanced dataset with a constant size of 5000 samples to ensure fairness in comparison. Results show that CAGN-GAT Fusion demonstrates stable and competitive accuracy, recall, and F1-score, even though it does not achieve the highest performance in every dataset. Our analysis also highlights the impact of adaptive graph construction techniques, including small changes in connections (edge perturbation) and selective hiding of features (feature masking), improving detection performance. The findings confirm that GNNs, particularly CAGN-GAT Fusion, are robust and computationally efficient, making them well-suited for resource-constrained environments. Future work will explore GraphSAGE layers and multiview graph construction techniques to further enhance adaptability and detection accuracy.},

Existing approaches often rely on static feature subsets or manual intervention, limiting adaptability and scalability. However, dynamic, per-instance feature selection methods and model-specific interpretability in reinforcement learning remain underexplored. This study proposes a human-in-the-loop (HITL) feature selection framework integrated into a Double Deep Q-Network (DDQN) using a Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN). Our novel approach leverages simulated human feedback and stochastic distribution-based sampling, specifically Beta, to iteratively refine feature subsets per data instance, improving flexibility in feature selection. The KAN-DDQN achieved notable test accuracies of 93% on MNIST and 83% on FashionMNIST, outperforming conventional MLP-DDQN models by up to 9%. The KAN-based model provided high interpretability via symbolic representation while using 4 times fewer neurons in the hidden layer than MLPs did. Comparatively, the models without feature selection achieved test accuracies of only 58% on MNIST and 64% on FashionMNIST, highlighting significant gains with our framework. Pruning and visualization further enhanced model transparency by elucidating decision pathways. These findings present a scalable, interpretable solution for feature selection that is suitable for applications requiring real-time, adaptive decision-making with minimal human oversight.},

	abstract = {The detection and tracking of small, occluded objects such as pedestrians, cyclists, and motorbikes pose significant challenges for traffic surveillance systems because of their erratic movement, frequent occlusion, and poor visibility in dynamic urban environments. Traditional methods like YOLO11, while proficient in spatial feature extraction for precise detection, often struggle with these small and dynamically moving objects, particularly in handling real-time data updates and resource efficiency. This paper introduces DGNN-YOLO, a novel framework that integrates dynamic graph neural networks (DGNNs) with YOLO11 to address these limitations. Unlike standard GNNs, DGNNs are chosen for their superior ability to dynamically update graph structures in real-time, which enables adaptive and robust tracking of objects in highly variable urban traffic scenarios. This framework constructs and regularly updates its graph representations, capturing objects as nodes and their interactions as edges, thus effectively responding to rapidly changing conditions. Additionally, DGNN-YOLO incorporates Grad-CAM, Grad-CAM++, and Eigen-CAM visualization techniques to enhance interpretability and foster trust, offering insights into the model's decision-making process. Extensive experiments validate the framework's performance, achieving a precision of 0.8382, recall of 0.6875, and mAP@0.5:0.95 of 0.6476, significantly outperforming existing methods. This study offers a scalable and interpretable solution for real-time traffic surveillance and significantly advances intelligent transportation systems' capabilities by addressing the critical challenge of detecting and tracking small, occluded objects.},

The first step in designing a CMS involves grouping parts and machines. In this paper, four integer programming formulations are presented for grouping parts and machines in a CMS at both the design and operational levels for a generalized grouping problem, where each part has more than one process plan, and each operation of a process plan can be performed on more than one machine. The minimization of inter-cell and intra-cell movements is achieved by assigning the maximum possible number of consecutive operations of a part type to the same cell and to the same machine, respectively. The suitability of minimizing inter-cell and intra-cell movements as an objective, compared to other objectives such as minimizing investment costs on machines, operating costs, etc., is discussed. Numerical examples are included to illustrate the workings of the formulations.},

A process route lists the machines corresponding to each part of the operation. Inspired by the extensive and widespread use of network flow algorithms, this research formulates the process route family formation for generalized grouping as a unit capacity minimum cost network flow model. The objective is to minimize dissimilarity (based on the machines required) among the process routes within a family. The proposed model optimally solves the process route family formation problem without pre-specifying the number of part families to be formed. The process route of family formation is the first stage in a hierarchical procedure. For the second stage (machine cell formation), two procedures, a quadratic assignment programming (QAP) formulation and a heuristic procedure, are proposed. The QAP simultaneously assigns process route families and machines to a pre-specified number of cells in such a way that total machine utilization is maximized. The heuristic procedure for machine cell formation is hierarchical in nature. Computational results for some test problems show that the QAP and the heuristic procedure yield the same results.},

Quantum machine learning, with its capability to leverage the extensive Hilbert space of quantum hardware, offers a promising solution. However, current quantum graph neural networks (GNNs) lack robustness to noise and are often constrained by fixed symmetry groups, limiting adaptability in complex particle interaction modeling. This paper demonstrates that replacing the Lorentz Group Equivariant Block modules in LorentzNet with a dressed quantum circuit significantly enhances performance despite using nearly 5.5 times fewer parameters. Our Lorentz-Equivariant Quantum Graph Neural Network (Lorentz-EQGNN) achieved 74.00\% test accuracy and an AUC of 87.38% on the Quark-Gluon jet tagging dataset, outperforming the classical and quantum GNNs with a reduced architecture using only 4 qubits. On the Electron-Photon dataset, Lorentz-EQGNN reached 67.00% test accuracy and an AUC of 68.20%, demonstrating competitive results with just 800 training samples. Evaluation of our model on generic MNIST and FashionMNIST datasets confirmed Lorentz-EQGNN's efficiency, achieving 88.10\% and 74.80% test accuracy, respectively. Ablation studies validated the impact of quantum components on performance, with notable improvements in background rejection rates over classical counterparts.

However, existing contrastive learning (CL) frameworks struggle to leverage rationale-aware augmentations effectively, often lacking supervision signals that guide the extraction of salient features and facing computational efficiency issues such as high parameter counts. In this study, we demonstrate that integrating a quantum rationale generator (QRG) within our proposed Quantum Rationale-aware Graph Contrastive Learning (QRGCL) framework significantly enhances jet discrimination performance, reducing reliance on labeled data and capturing discriminative features. Evaluated on the quark-gluon jet dataset, QRGCL achieves an AUC score of 77.53\% while maintaining a compact architecture of only 45 QRG parameters, outperforming classical, quantum, and hybrid GCL and GNN benchmarks.

Current heart disease prediction models based on classical machine learning face limitations, including poor handling of high-dimensional, imbalanced data, limited performance on small datasets, and a lack of uncertainty quantification, while also being difficult for healthcare professionals to interpret. To address these issues, we introduce KACQ-DCNN, a novel classical-quantum hybrid dual-channel neural network that replaces traditional multilayer perceptrons and convolutional layers with Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs). This approach enhances function approximation with learnable univariate activation functions, reducing model complexity and improving generalization. The KACQ-DCNN 4-qubit 1-layered model significantly outperforms 37 benchmark models across multiple metrics, achieving an accuracy of 92.03\%, a macro-average precision, recall, and F1 score of 92.00\%, and an ROC-AUC score of 94.77\%. Ablation studies demonstrate the synergistic benefits of combining classical and quantum components with KAN. Additionally, explainability techniques like LIME and SHAP provide feature-level insights, improving model transparency, while uncertainty quantification via conformal prediction ensures robust probability estimates. These results suggest that KACQ-DCNN offers a promising path toward more accurate, interpretable, and reliable heart disease predictions, paving the way for advancements in cardiovascular healthcare.},

	abstract = {Geomagnetic storms, which are brought on by the transmission of solar wind energy to the Earth's magnetic field, have thepotential to substantially damage a number of critical infrastructure systems, including GPS, satellite communications, and electrical power grids. The disturbance storm-time (Dst) index is used to determine how strong these storms are. Using real-time solar wind data, a variety of models—empirical, physics-based, and machine-learning—have improved Dst forecasting during the last thirty years. However, forecasting extreme geomagnetic events is still difficult, requiring reliable ways to manage unprocessed, real-time data streams in the face of noise and sensor failures. This research aims to create a Dst forecasting model that employs specific real-time solar wind data feeds, functions under realistic restrictions, and outperforms state-of-the-art models in terms of prediction. Innovative methods are needed to solve this complex challenge, as it is not immediately evident what the optimal solution is. This study introduces a groundbreaking application of quantum computing inspace weather forecasting. Our novel framework represents a pioneering integration of classical and quantum computing,conformal prediction, and explainable AI (XAI) within a hybrid neural network architecture. To ensure high-quality input data,we developed a comprehensive data preprocessing pipeline that includes feature selection, normalization, aggregation, and imputation. The hybrid classical–quantum neural network, TriQXNet, leverages three parallel channels to process preprocessed solar wind data, significantly enhancing the robustness and accuracy of Dst index predictions. Our model predicts the Dst index using solar wind measurements from NASA's ACE and NOAA's DSCOVR satellites for the hour that is currently underway (t0)as well as the hour that will follow (t+1), providing vital advance notice to lessen the negative consequences of geomagnetic storms. TriQXNet outperforms 13 state-of-the-art hybrid deep-learning models, achieving a root mean squared error of 9.27 nanoteslas (nT). Rigorous evaluation through 10-fold cross-validated paired t-tests confirmed TriQXNet's superior performance with 95% confidence. By implementing conformal prediction techniques, we provide quantifiable uncertainty in our forecasts, which is essential for operational decision-making. Additionally, incorporating XAI methods such as ShapTime and permutation feature importance enhances the interpretability of the model, fostering greater trust in its predictions. Comparative analysis revealed that TriQXNet outperforms existing models in the literature and the model deployed by the CIRES/NCEI geomagnetism team. Our model demonstrated exceptional forecasting accuracy for dual hours in a specific case study involving rapid Dstvalue decline. This research sets a new level of expectations for geomagnetic storm forecasting, showing the potential of classical–quantum hybrid models to improve space weather prediction capabilities.},

We developed and implemented several deep learning models to classify the states (dry, moist, wet, icy, snowy, slushy). Depending upon the best model, the weather forecast app will predict the state taking the Ta, Tsurf, Height, Speed, Water, etc. into consideration. The crucial part was to define a safety metric which is the product of the accident rates based on friction and the accident rates based on states. We developed a regressor that will predict the safety metric depending upon the state obtained from the classifier and the friction obtained from the sensor data.

The findings revealed that natural PCS are 11 times more enriched in small proteins compared to random PCS. This research sheds light on the strong constraint on PCS sequences and provides valuable insights into genome evolution and conservation.},

	abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic has affected millions of people globally, with respiratory organs being strongly affected in individuals with comorbidities. Medical imaging-based diagnosis and prognosis have become increasingly popular in clinical settings for detecting COVID-19 lung infections. Among various medical imaging modalities, ultrasound stands out as a low-cost, mobile, and radiation-safe imaging technology. In this comprehensive review, we focus on AI-driven studies utilizing lung ultrasound (LUS) for COVID-19 detection and analysis. We provide a detailed overview of both publicly available and private LUS datasets and categorize the AI studies according to the dataset they used. Additionally, we systematically analyzed and tabulated the studies across various dimensions, including data preprocessing methods, AI models, cross-validation techniques, and evaluation metrics. In total, we reviewed 60 articles, 41 of which utilized public datasets, while the remaining employed private data. Our findings suggest that ultrasound-based AI studies for COVID-19 detection have great potential for clinical use, especially for children and pregnant women. Our review also provides a useful summary for future researchers and clinicians who may be interested in the field.},

	abstract = {Supply chain management relies on accurate backorder prediction for optimizing inventory control, reducing costs, and enhancing customer satisfaction. Traditional machine-learning models struggle with large-scale datasets and complex relationships. This research introduces a novel methodological framework for supply chain backorder prediction, addressing the challenge of collecting large real-world datasets with 90% accuracy. Our proposed model demonstrates remarkable accuracy in predicting backorders on short and imbalanced datasets. We capture intricate patterns and dependencies by leveraging quantum-inspired techniques within the quantum-classical neural network QAmplifyNet. Experimental evaluations on a benchmark dataset establish QAmplifyNet’s superiority over eight classical models, three classically stacked quantum ensembles, five quantum neural networks, and a deep reinforcement learning model. Its ability to handle short, imbalanced datasets makes it ideal for supply chain management. We evaluate seven preprocessing techniques, selecting the best one based on logistic regression’s performance on each preprocessed dataset. The model’s interpretability is enhanced using Explainable artificial intelligence techniques. Practical implications include improved inventory control, reduced backorders, and enhanced operational efficiency. QAmplifyNet also achieved the highest F1-score of 94% for predicting "Not Backorder" and 75% for predicting "backorder," outperforming all other models. It also exhibited the highest AUC-ROC score of 79.85%, further validating its superior predictive capabilities. QAmplifyNet seamlessly integrates into real-world supply chain management systems, empowering proactive decision-making and efficient resource allocation. Future work involves exploring additional quantum-inspired techniques, expanding the dataset, and investigating other supply chain applications. This research unlocks the potential of quantum computing in supply chain optimization and paves the way for further exploration of quantum-inspired machine learning models in supply chain management. Our framework and QAmplifyNet model offer a breakthrough approach to supply chain backorder prediction, offering superior performance and opening new avenues for leveraging quantum-inspired techniques in supply chain management.},

	abstract = {Supply chain risk assessment (SCRA) has witnessed a profound evolution through the integration of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) techniques, revolutionizing predictive capabilities and risk mitigation strategies. The significance of this evolution stems from the critical role of robust risk management strategies in ensuring operational resilience and continuity within modern supply chains. Previous reviews have outlined established methodologies but have overlooked emerging AI/ML techniques, leaving a notable research gap in understanding their practical implications within SCRA. This paper conducts a systematic literature review combined with a comprehensive bibliometric analysis. We meticulously examined 1,717 papers and derived key insights from a select group of 48 articles published between 2014 and 2023. The review fills this research gap by addressing pivotal research questions, and exploring existing AI/ML techniques, methodologies, findings, and future trajectories, thereby providing a more encompassing view of the evolving landscape of SCRA. Our study unveils the transformative impact of AI/ML models, such as Random Forest, XGBoost, and hybrids, in substantially enhancing precision within SCRA. It underscores adaptable post-COVID strategies, advocating for resilient contingency plans and aligning with evolving risk landscapes. Significantly, this review surpasses previous examinations by accentuating emerging AI/ML techniques and their practical implications within SCRA. Furthermore, it highlights the contributions through a comprehensive bibliometric analysis, revealing publication trends, influential authors, and highly cited articles.},

	abstract = {This article systematically identifies and comparatively analyzes state-of-the-art supply chain (SC) forecasting strategies and technologies within a specific timeframe, encompassing a comprehensive review of 152 papers spanning from 1969 to 2023. A novel framework has been proposed incorporating Big Data Analytics in SC Management (problem identification, data sources, exploratory data analysis, machine-learning model training, hyperparameter tuning, performance evaluation, and optimization), forecasting effects on human workforce, inventory, and overall SC. Initially, the need to collect data according to SC strategy and how to collect them has been discussed. The article discusses the need for different types of forecasting according to the period or SC objective. The SC KPIs and the error-measurement systems have been recommended to optimize the top-performing model. The adverse effects of phantom inventory on forecasting and the dependence of managerial decisions on the SC KPIs for determining model performance parameters and improving operations management, transparency, and planning efficiency have been illustrated. The cyclic connection within the framework introduces preprocessing optimization based on the post-process KPIs, optimizing the overall control process (inventory management, workforce determination, cost, production and capacity planning). The contribution of this research lies in the standard SC process framework proposal, recommended forecasting data analysis, forecasting effects on SC performance, machine learning algorithms optimization followed, and in shedding light on future research.},

	abstract = {Sentiment analysis is a pivotal tool in understanding public opinion, consumer behavior, and social trends, underpinning applications ranging from market research to political analysis. However, existing sentiment analysis models frequently encounter challenges related to linguistic diversity, model generalizability, explainability, and limited availability of labeled datasets. To address these shortcomings, we propose the Transformer and Attention-based Bidirectional LSTM for Sentiment Analysis (TRABSA) model, a novel hybrid sentiment analysis framework that integrates transformer-based architecture, attention mechanism, and recurrent neural networks like BiLSTM. The TRABSA model leverages the powerful RoBERTa-based transformer model for initial feature extraction, capturing complex linguistic nuances from a vast corpus of tweets. This is followed by an attention mechanism that highlights the most informative parts of the text, enhancing the model’s focus on critical sentiment-bearing elements. Finally, the BiLSTM networks process these refined features, capturing temporal dependencies and improving the overall sentiment classification into positive, neutral, and negative classes. Leveraging the latest RoBERTa-based transformer model trained on a vast corpus of 124M tweets, our research bridges existing gaps in sentiment analysis benchmarks, ensuring state-of-the-art accuracy and relevance. Furthermore, we contribute to data diversity by augmenting existing datasets with 411,885 tweets from 32 English-speaking countries and 7,500 tweets from various US states. This study also compares six word-embedding techniques, identifying the most robust preprocessing and embedding methodologies crucial for accurate sentiment analysis and model performance. We meticulously label tweets into positive, neutral, and negative classes using three distinct lexicon-based approaches and select the best one, ensuring optimal sentiment analysis outcomes and model efficacy. Here, we demonstrate that the TRABSA model outperforms the current seven traditional machine learning models, four stacking models, and four hybrid deep learning models, yielding notable gain in accuracy (94%) and effectiveness with a macro average precision of 94%, recall of 93%, and F1-score of 94%. Our further evaluation involves two extended and four external datasets, demonstrating the model’s consistent superiority, robustness, and generalizability across diverse contexts and datasets. Finally, by conducting a thorough study with SHAP and LIME explainable visualization approaches, we offer insights into the interpretability of the TRABSA model, improving comprehension and confidence in the model’s predictions. Our study results make it easier to analyze how citizens respond to resources and events during pandemics since they are integrated into a decision-support system. Applications of this system provide essential assistance for efficient pandemic management, such as resource planning, crowd control, policy formation, vaccination tactics, and quick reaction programs.},

This study explores male domestic violence (MDV) for the first time, highlighting the factors that influence it and tackling the challenges posed by a significant categorical imbalance of 5:1 and a lack of data. We collected data from nine major cities in Bangladesh and conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the underlying dynamics. EDA revealed patterns such as the high prevalence of verbal abuse, the influence of financial dependency, and the role of familial and socio-economic factors in MDV. To predict and analyze MDV, we implemented 10 traditional machine learning (ML) models, three deep learning models, and two ensemble models, including stacking and hybrid approaches. We propose a stacking ensemble model with ANN and CatBoost as base classifiers and Logistic Regression as the meta-model, which demonstrated the best performance, achieving 95% accuracy, a 99.29% AUC, and balanced metrics across evaluation criteria. Model-specific feature importance analysis of the base classifiers identified key features influencing their individual decision-making. Model-agnostic explainable AI techniques, SHAP and LIME, provided local and global insights into the decision-making processes of the proposed model, enhancing transparency and interpretability. Additionally, statistical validation using paired t-tests with 10-fold cross-validation and Bonferroni correction (alpha = 0.0036) confirmed the superior performance of our proposed model over alternatives.},

	abstract = {This research explores the intricate landscape of Musculoskeletal Disorder (MSD) risk factors, employing a novel fusion of Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and mode-based ranking methodologies. Enhancing knowledge of MSD risk factors, their classification, and their relative severity is the main goal of enabling more focused preventative and treatment efforts. The study benchmarks eight NLP models, integrating pre-trained transformers, cosine similarity, and various distance metrics to categorize risk factors into personal, biomechanical, workplace, psychological, and organizational classes. Key findings reveal that the Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) model with cosine similarity attains an overall accuracy of 28%, while the sentence transformer, coupled with Euclidean, Bray–Curtis, and Minkowski distances, achieves a flawless accuracy score of 100%. Using a 10-fold cross-validation strategy and performing rigorous statistical paired t-tests and Cohen's d tests (with a 5% significance level assumed), the study provides the results with greater validity. To determine the severity hierarchy of MSD risk variables, the research uses survey data and a mode-based ranking technique parallel to the classification efforts. Intriguingly, the rankings align precisely with the previous literature, reaffirming the consistency and reliability of the approach. "Working posture" emerges as the most severe risk factor, emphasizing the critical role of proper posture in preventing MSD. The collective perceptions of survey participants underscore the significance of factors like "Job insecurity", "Effort reward imbalance", and "Poor employee facility" in contributing to MSD risks. The convergence of rankings provides actionable insights for organizations aiming to reduce the prevalence of MSD. The study concludes with implications for targeted interventions, recommendations for improving workplace conditions, and avenues for future research. This holistic approach, integrating NLP and mode-based ranking, contributes to a more sophisticated comprehension of MSD risk factors and opens the door for more effective strategies in occupational health.},

	abstract = {Accurate demand forecasting is crucial for optimizing supply chain management. Traditional methods often fail to capture complex patterns from seasonal variability and special events. Despite advancements in deep learning, interpretable forecasting models remain a challenge. To address this, we introduce the Multi-Channel Data Fusion Network (MCDFN), a hybrid architecture that integrates Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory networks (LSTM), and Gated Recurrent Units (GRU) to enhance predictive performance by extracting spatial and temporal features from time series data. Our rigorous benchmarking demonstrates that MCDFN outperforms seven other deep-learning models, achieving superior metrics: MSE (23.5738), RMSE (4.8553), MAE (3.9991), and MAPE (20.1575%). Additionally, MCDFN's predictions were statistically indistinguishable from actual values, confirmed by a paired t-test with a 5% p-value and a 10-fold cross-validated statistical paired t-test. We apply explainable AI techniques like ShapTime and Permutation Feature Importance to enhance interpretability. This research advances demand forecasting methodologies and offers practical guidelines for integrating MCDFN into supply chain systems, highlighting future research directions for scalability and user-friendly deployment.},

	abstract = {Integrating Internet of Things (IoT) technology inside the cold supply chain can enhance transparency, efficiency, and quality, optimize operating procedures, and increase productivity. The integration of the IoT in this complicated setting is hindered by specific barriers that require thorough examination. Prominent barriers to IoT implementation in a cold supply chain, which is the main objective, are identified using a two-stage model. After reviewing the available literature on IoT implementation, 13 barriers were identified. The survey data were cross-validated for quality, and Cronbach's alpha test was employed to ensure validity. This study applies the interpretative structural modeling technique in the first phase to identify the main barriers. Among these barriers, "regulatory compliance" and "cold chain networks" are the key drivers of IoT adoption strategies. MICMAC's driving and dependence power element categorization helps evaluate barrier interactions. In the second phase of this study, a decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory methodology was employed to identify causal relationships between barriers and evaluate them according to their relative importance. Each cause is a potential drive, and if its efficiency can be enhanced, the system benefits as a whole. The findings provide industry stakeholders, governments, and organizations with significant drivers of IoT adoption to overcome these barriers and optimize the utilization of IoT technology to improve the effectiveness and reliability of the cold supply chain.},

	abstract = {Many studies have shown that ergonomically designed furniture improves productivity and well-being. As computers have become a part of students' academic lives, they will continue to grow in the future. We propose anthropometric-based furniture dimensions that are suitable for university students to improve computer laboratory ergonomics. We collected data from 380 participants and analyzed 11 anthropometric measurements, correlating them with 11 furniture dimensions. Two types of furniture were found and studied in different university computer laboratories: (1) a non-adjustable chair with a non-adjustable table and (2) an adjustable chair with a non-adjustable table. The mismatch calculation showed a significant difference between existing furniture dimensions and anthropometric measurements, indicating that 7 of the 11 existing furniture dimensions need improvement. The one-way ANOVA test with a significance level of 5% also showed a significant difference between the anthropometric data and existing furniture dimensions. All 11 dimensions were determined to match students' anthropometric data. The proposed dimensions were found to be more compatible and showed reduced mismatch percentages for nine furniture dimensions and nearly zero mismatches for seat width, backrest height, and under the hood for both males and females compared to the existing furniture dimensions. The proposed dimensions of the furniture set with adjustable seat height showed slightly improved match results for seat height and seat-to-table clearance, which showed zero mismatches compared with the non-adjustable furniture set. The table width and table depth dimensions were suggested according to Barnes and Squires' ergonomic work envelope model, considering hand reach. The positions of the keyboard and mouse are also suggested according to the work envelope. The monitor position and viewing angle were proposed according to OSHA guidelines. This study suggests that the proposed dimensions can improve comfort levels, reducing the risk of musculoskeletal disorders among students. Further studies on the implementation and long-term effects of the proposed dimensions in real-world computer laboratory settings are recommended.},
